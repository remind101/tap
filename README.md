# Tap

Tap is a framework for writing services driven by messages from a Rabbit queue.

## Development

Tap is written with Go and expects that you have a working Go 1.3
development environment. You should also have
[godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) installed and available in
your `$PATH`.

## Tests

You can run unit tests with:

```bash
$ make
```
